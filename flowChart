In this app, users are given a quiz on different parts of coding. 

    Intro Page
        titleBar
            highscoresLink
                Has to use local storage, should be easy enough to write. if (localhighscores) -> createElement highscoresbox -> show to user
            title
                i just like titles even though it doesnt ask for one explicitly
            timer
                Countdown timer that starts when you start the quiz. Should add time per question, 15 seconds per question. 
                Instead of allowing the user to choose question amount, I am going to have 3 difficulties with more questions that allow less time.
                    Easy-5 questions; 15 seconds per
                    Medium-8 questions; 13 seconds per; more difficult questions
                    Hard-10 questions; 10 seconds per; higher penalty for wrong Answers
                This allows me to make the function more simple, and lets me hard code certain values into the page.

            Question
                Use java to swap the question text out on correct answer input. Can probably get the questions off the internet all ready to go.
            Answers
                I could pre-set the answers, it looks like in the reference gif that they put the numbers (1:, 2:, etc) inside the input. 
                I would prefer to have the answers be randomly assigned so that each quiz has the answers in a different order to reduce the ability to memorize patterns over information.
            alert message
                a simple message that displays either correct or incorrect to the user.
